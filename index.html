                    <div id="about-content">
                        <h2>The Issue</h2>
                        <p>Climate change is a major issue that affects the world on many fronts, one of the most significant of which is agriculture. According to a document
                            released by the OECD, not only will farmers face production issues, but resources will also become more scarce, leading to a cyclic pattern of harm. 
                            Moreover, the agriculture industry is one of the major contributors to climate change, both directly and indirectly. Therefore, it is important to consider 
                            agricultural practices when developing solutions and mitigations to the climate change issue (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/agriculture/ministerial/background/notes/4_background_note.pdf">full article</a>). 
                            This website was developed to help spur that movement by providing resources through which farmers can evaluate their carbon and water footprints and learn
                            about ways they can implement in order to reduce the impacts of climate change.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Program</h2>
                        <p>The team behind this project participated in the Next Gen Coders Network, a program that connects students from Iraq, the Palestinian Territories, and the
                            United States. Through this program, students learn about intercultural communication and software development. Over the course of 10 weeks, teams of 3-6 students
                            design and build out a prototype website or application that addresses a global issue. This program highlights the importance of diverse voices and 
                            skills, especially when it comes to examining and addressing topics on an international level. The program is sponsored by the Stevens Initiative, 
                            which seeks to connect students in the United States and the Middle East and North Africa through virtual settings, and the U.S. 
                            Department of State. You can read more about the <a href="https://www.worldlearning.org/program/nextgen-coders-network/">Next Gen Coders Network here</a>, or the

                        <h2>The Team</h2>
                        <p>Three students collaborated to build this website.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Khulud Mahbub Alam.</b> Khulud, a student at Arab Open University, directed the team's efforts and designed the prototype for the website. He also 
                                managed the team's documents and reports. 
                                He enjoys baking cakes, skateboarding, and exploring new hobbies. 
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Nisreen Ahmad Khalaf.</b> Nisreen is a medical student studying anesthesiology. She conducted research for the project, reviewing multiple
                            sources in order to write the content for the website.</li>
                            <li><b>Noor Rafiq.</b> Noor is a student at the University of Virginia. She built the website, focusing on highlighting the information 
                            the team researched. In her free time, she pursues creative writing and practicing cello.</li>

                        <p>Carbon emissions are a large contributor to global warming and climate change. According to Stephanie Osmanski, the effects of climate change include melting
                            polar ice caps, rising sea levels, the destruction of natural habitats, and increasingly severe weather (<a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/how-do-carbon-emissions-affect-environment">full article</a>).
                            
                            Human activities contribute greatly to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Examples of these activities include the use of oil, coal, and gas, as well as
                            deforestation (<a href="https://www.che-project.eu/news/main-sources-carbon-dioxide-emissions">full article</a>).
                            
                            Currently, it is difficult to reduce CO2 emissions because of the global economy. For example, lower demand for a product
                            causes prices to be lowered. However, low prices result in higher demand. According to Jilles van den Beukel, when coal prices decreased, the market share of coal
                            increased significantly (<a href="https://energypost.eu/difficult-reduce-co2-emissions/">full article</a>).
                        </p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A recent study showed a remarkable decline in the volume of daily emissions from carbon dioxide, worldwide, a 17% earlier April, compared
                            to recorded levels in the same period from 2019. The study returned to government policies and prohibitions due to COVID-19 and prevent transporting
                            between countries 17%, compared to 2019, while the decline is 26% per state. She explained that the transport sector is more declined in carbon
                            dioxide emissions, accounting for 43% of the world's total decline, and people in their homes resulted in lack of road vehicles, while the 
                            industry and energy sector scores 43% of total. The aviation sector, although is one of the largest contamined sectors, only 3% of 
                            carbon emissions are represented in normal circumstances.
                        </p>
                        <p>Globally, at least 2 billion people are used to drink polluted water. According to the World Health Organization, by 2025, half of the world's population will live in areas 
                            of water shortages. The data provided states that "in low and middle-income countries, 38% of health care facilities lack an improved water source, and 19% do
                            not have improved sanitation facilities, 35% lacked water and soap to wash hands" (<a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/water">full article</a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>Climate change impacts due to increased CO2 emission have been demonstrated further by changes in the behavior of snow and ice. 
                            The United Nations reports that "by 2050, the number of people at risk of floods will increase from its current level of 1.2 billion to 1.6 billion".
                        </p>
                        <p>The United Nations also reports an increase in global mean temperature. Beginning in 2010, the temperatures recorded have been among the warmest 
                            ever observed. Scientists predict that these temperatures will only continue to increase, with the difference being as much as 5 degrees Celsius
                            before the end of the century (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/key-findings">full article</a>).

                            <h2>Effects of Carbon Dioxide</h2>
                            <p>Carbon dioxide is considered one of the harmful gases that affect human health, as continuous exposure
                                to it leads to a series of side effects, and they are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Short-term effects.</b> They occur when high levels of carbon dioxide are inhaled within a short 
                                time, which leads to suffocation (by replacing the air with carbon dioxide), unconsciousness, headache,
                                vertigo and double vision, inability to concentrate, tinnitus, and convulsive seizures.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Long-term effects.</b>                                            
                                    They occur when carbon dioxide is inhaled in small amounts but regularly, which leads to changes in 
                                    bone calcium or changes in the metabolism processes inside the body. Breathing carbon dioxide in large quantities
                                    can be life threatening, and if carbon dioxide gas is touches - when it is in its solid state - it  may cause
                                    frostbite disease or the formation of blisters on the body. 
                                </li>
